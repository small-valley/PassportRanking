## Motivation

I wanted to know which country I can go without visa, and compare between two countries to find out differences.  
Seeing the differences, it might be helpfull to understand the international relationships between countries.

## What I learn

This is my first React project.  
I have learned basic knowledge of React and how to use state.

## Future Improvement

Grabbing data from backend server.
